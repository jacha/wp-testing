Create psychological tests/quizes with scales connected with results through simple formulas like "extraversion > 50%"

== Description ==

With the help of this plugin now you can create typical and advanced psychological tests (quizes, assessments).

Typical psychological test consists of **questions** and **answers**. A respondent answers all of the questions and gets **results**. This is how the box outside looks like.

Inside the box we also have **scales** each connected with the particular answer with **scores** and **results**, that are calculated with the help of **simple formulas** like: "extraversion > 50%". Where "extraversion" is a sum of respondent's scores from extraversion scale. We didn't invent anything new — all this has been already invented in 19th century.

Test answers, scales, results and categories are edited through **wordpress standard editors**, similar to categories editor. You can associate them in sidebar. Whether test questions, answers and formulas are edited with standard wordpress metaboxes, behind content. You can even reorder them if you like. At the top of content editor you have **button for quick access** to those metaboxes: Add New Questions, Edit Questions and Scores, Edit Formulas.

As to **formulas** you can be sure — we have simple formula editor, that has buttons for each scale (with sum of it's scores) and allowed comparisions.

Tests are treated for WordPress like posts — they appear on home page and inside their categories pages if selected. But if you don't want your test to appear on home page you can uncheck **"Publish on the home page"** in "Publish" metabox and this particular test will not appear on homepage.

To minimize author's time we have **Quick Fill** for questions and scores. You can **quick fill questions from text** and they will fill appropriate fields. Same way you can **Quick Fill Scores** in many questions some answer+scale combination. 

Wp-testing localized in seven languages: English, Russian (native speaker), German, French, Dutch, Swedish and Bulgarian (native speaker). English, Russian and Bulgarian have good quality — others need review. You can easily add your language through excellent [Transifiex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-testing/) service. **Translators** and *reviewers* are kindly welcome!

**Quality** and **compatibility** are taken really seriously. Plugin tested on [37 combinations](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing) of WordPress (from 3.2 to 4.0) and PHP (from 5.2 to 5.5) plus one custom combination for old MySQL storage engine (MyISAM). So you can be sure, that it will just work, even if you don't have  the latest WordPress or your hosting doesn't have the latest versions of PHP/MySQL. [Build status image](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing.svg?branch=develop) is available.
